# dotfiles
Welcome to my dotfiles repo. This is just a place I can host my dotfiles because I like consistency. You are welcome to use them if you would like, however, like everyone on linux I suggest you create your own because where is the fun in using someone else's config when you can customize your system to your liking.

Everything in the root directory is used on all my devices and the things in the folders are for their respective devices.
